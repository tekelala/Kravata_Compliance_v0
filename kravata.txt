Kravata is web3 for all
Global Future and Our Positioning
The concept of individuals holding their liquid capital reserves in a single asset is fading away due to irresponsible handling of money by governments. People are starting to consider having a portion of their assets in crypto-assets. A "Card" will emerge that knows your currency portfolio and a bot decides the best asset to pay the expense, optimizing for exchange rates and asset value at a given time.

This trend will also apply to businesses which will have an asset portfolio for their transactions. Contracts that negotiate in portfolios of currencies will emerge. Crypto asset issuances will begin to move into retail, with platforms allowing conversions and transactions.

Our role in this world is to facilitate these changes, particularly in Colombia. Another alternative is tokenizing, which presents a marketing challenge rather than a technological one. The aim is to reach the B2B2C without directly reaching the consumer, through a third party.

LATAM's Situation and Our Mission
LATAM has a problem; it doesn't have a single currency. People are closer to using different payment systems than using a bank, as we see with the adoption of digital wallets.

The world of crypto has the advantage of transacting without an intermediary. We enable businesses to offer crypto services to their users. It's not the end, but a means to achieve the expected results. The infrastructure in the USA, Asia, and Europe has already started, but not in LATAM at the same pace.

Our mission is for businesses to create or have access to the platform to offer better services through crypto-assets. We aim to have a fully functional platform, an ecosystem of inter-operability, where roughly 5% of transactions flow through it, focusing on gaming, remittances, exchanges, and loyalty programs.

Customer Roadmap
Our customer roadmap from a year ago consisted of:

Crypto-natives: They have crypto but not FIAT, and their problem is that they don't have how to change from crypto to fiat.
Fintechs: They have money but no crypto. They want to show more use cases of crypto or that they have something of crypto.
Neobanks: They could start offering credit and savings collateralized in crypto.
Retail platforms: Mobile operators, supermarkets, and marketplaces that want to receive payments in crypto.
Banks: Offering crypto custody to a bank. There are regulatory problems and risk aversion issues.
We offer four key products:

Compliance: Comply with regulations for transactions while respecting the laws and not risking the organization legally or reputationally.
Liquidity: Allow assets to be converted quickly into cash without significant loss of value.
Custody: Protection and management of crypto-assets.
Payment methods: Transaction processing.
Our Current Customers and Future Prospects
Our current clients are arbitrageurs and businesses like Littio that want to take advantage of the exchange scenario to maintain assets in stable coins.

We need to understand the remaining 30% of the market, which has savings in currencies other than stable coins. We must figure out how to convince these crypto natives to use our gateway instead of others.

We are divided into two sections: stable coins and altcoins.

Stable Coins: Used for remittances, businesses or people who want to move people from one country to another.
Altcoins: Allow users to receive and monetize cryptos.
We're developing two dimensions: technology for faster, more efficient processes, and compliance to maintain legal operation in countries that demand our clients.

The aim is to build an operation so cost-effective for clients that it becomes expensive for them to leave us. We don't want to capture the market through high prices, but rather through offering a superior, more efficient service that fits seamlessly into their business model. We want to be an integral part of their operations.

The second part of our strategy is to leverage the emerging trend of crypto in LATAM. To achieve this, we will focus on two major initiatives:

Educational Campaigns: Building trust in crypto among businesses and consumers is a crucial step towards wider adoption. We will conduct educational campaigns to clarify common misconceptions about crypto and show businesses and consumers how they can benefit from crypto.

Partnerships: We aim to partner with fintechs, neobanks, retail platforms, and potentially banks to broaden the reach of our services. These partnerships will not only offer our partners an entry into the crypto space but also strengthen our position in the market.

Lastly, to successfully convert the 30% of the market with savings in currencies other than stable coins, we need to understand their motivations and concerns regarding crypto. We will conduct market research and user interviews to better understand their needs and build solutions that address these needs.

Our Future Steps
In conclusion, our future steps would include:

Improving and optimizing our current products to create an operation so cost-effective that it becomes expensive for clients to leave us.
Conducting educational campaigns to build trust in crypto among businesses and consumers.
Forming strategic partnerships with fintechs, neobanks, retail platforms, and potentially banks to broaden the reach of our services.
Conducting market research and user interviews to better understand the needs of the remaining 30% of the market that has savings in currencies other than stable coins, and building solutions that address these needs.
By focusing on these strategies, we are confident that we can position ourselves at the forefront of the emerging crypto market in LATAM, helping businesses and consumers alike benefit from this transformative technology.
